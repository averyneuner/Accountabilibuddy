<h1>Accountabilibuddy</h1>
This application was created in an Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Software Product Development course. It was created to be an organizational tool for those who struggle to keep up with traditional planners and calendar apps. In creating this app, I served the roles of software developer, product manager, and UX designer. As of now (January 2025) this app is available for iOS download on the Apple app store. 

<h2>How it's made</h2>
<b>Used: Swift, Xcode, Apple Developer Program</b> <br> <br>

The app has a task or deadline accompanied by a date and time, task category, and the level of urgency. It has differing list views based on the category of the task. The app allows you to add new tasks easily and edit your tasks. It makes it easy to see when tasks are more urgent with bright colors. The app discards tasks when they are checked off so only uncompleted tasks appear.<br>
Accountabilibuddy was created in Xcode, using the features provided by the Apple developer program to set up buttons, lists, and screens. <br>
It was created equally to learn Swift and Apple development and to learn product design and development. Before beginning the programming process, my classmates and I conducted interviews with target users, prototyping with wireframing in Figma, prototype testing with potential users, and competitive product analysis. The design process was iterative with periodic check-ins to see how we could our design could pivot or evolve. At the end of the process, we conducted user testing and interviews. 

<h2>What it's for</h2>
I designed Accountabilibuddy to be an alternative organization app. Many productivity apps have a huge upfront mental cost for the user. They have to input all their information and organize it themselves before the app starts being helpful. Accountabilibuddy is simple in its functionality, limiting the upfront cost of using it. All a user has to do is put in their first task. It makes it easy for users to access all their tasks and deadlines in one place and orders them via importance to make it easy to choose which task to do next. 

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This app was the first I ever programmed in Swift. The learning curve for Swift, since it was substantially different than any language I'd learned before, was steep. It was a good learning experience and I now have confidence in using Swift. I also learned how to go through an iterative design process, center the needs of the user when creating a product, and wear different hats in the design process. Creating Accountabilibuddy was a valuable lesson in holding myself accountable (pun not intended) to getting things done.
